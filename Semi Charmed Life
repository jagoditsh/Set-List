[Verse 1]
                   G                          D          Dsus4
I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling, she living, she golden, 
    C
she lives for me, says she lives for me
  G           D       Dsus4
Ovation, her own motivation
C                                     G
She comes around and she goes down on me
                D           Dsus4
And I make her smile like a drug for you
C
   Do ever what you want to do
            G
Coming over you
           D               Dsus4
Keep on smiling what we go through
C
  One stop to the rhythm that divides you
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                  D        Dsus4            C
  And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
                                     G
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
               D          Dsus4     C
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
 
We give them the games we play she said
 
[Chorus 1]
G      D    Dsus4 C
I want something else
 
To get me through this
G  D              Dsus4 C
  Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby
G      D   Dsus4 C
I want something else
                            G  D Dsus4 C
I'm not listening when you say good~~~bye
 
[Post-chorus]
G            D       Dsus4
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
C
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
G            D       Dsus4
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
C
Doo-doo-doo
 
[Verse 2]
               G
The sky it was gold, it was rose
      D           Dsus4            C
I was taking sips of it through my nose
 
And I wish I could get back there
           G                          D                  Dsus4
Some place back there, smiling in the pictures you would take
C
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
          G                D
It won't stop I won't come down
       Dsus4        C
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
           G                     D              Dsus4
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
       C
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, said
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D               C
  How do I get back there to
      D                   C
The place where I fell asleep inside you?
 D              C
How do I get myself back to
      D
The place where you said
 
[Chorus 1]
G      D    Dsus4 C
I want something else
 
To get me through this
G   D              Dsus4 C
    Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby
G      D   Dsus4 C
I want something else, 
                           G    D Dsus4 C
I'm not listening when you   say good~~~bye
 
[Verse 3] (soft acoustic)
G                  D               C
  I believe in the sand beneath my toes
                                     G
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
    D                        C
I believe in the faith that grows
                              G           D Dsus4
And the four right chords can make me cry
C                                     G
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
                   D   Dsus4    C
And that would be  alright,   alright
 
[Bridge]
               D                C
And when the plane came in she said she was crashing
D               C                     D
  The velvet it rips in the city we tripped
                C
On the urge to feel alive
     G
But now I'm struggling to survive
       D                         C
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
 D                      C
You're the priestess I must confess
      D                       C
Those little red panties they pass the test
      G (hold)
Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress
D      C
One...
         D      C
And you hold me, 
          D      C
and we're broken.
            G
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now!
 
[Verse 4]
G           D          Dsus4 C
Feel myself head made of the ground
                           G   D Dsus4  C
I'm scared I'm not coming down, no     no, and I won't
        G      D  Dsus4
run for my life
C                                       G
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
               D    Dsus4 C
But nothing is alright,   alright
 
[Chorus 2]
G      Dsus4     C
I want something else
          G             Dsus4
To get me through this
C
 life, baby
G      Dsus4       C
I want   something else
              G        Dsus4  C     G/B Am
Not listening when you say goodbye
    C G/B Am
goodbye
    C G/B Am
goodbye
    G  D Dsus4 C
goodbye
G D Dsus4 C
 
[Post-chorus]
G            D       Dsus4
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
C
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
G            D       Dsus4     C
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
 
[Outro]
               G
The sky it was gold, it was rose
      D           Dsus4            C
I was taking sips of it through my nose
 
And I wish I could get back there
       D         Dsus4   C
in the place you used to start
G            D       Dsus4
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
C
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
 
G      D   Dsus4 C
I want something else
 
C G/B Am**
